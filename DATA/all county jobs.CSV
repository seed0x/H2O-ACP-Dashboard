Also Please send the below links and info to any new vendors. These videos should answer a lot of questions and make the training go smoother.

 

 

 

Please remember that we use our own scheduling system called Build with Pulte…or BWP.  The web address is [bwp.pulte.com]bwp.pulte.com. Once there click “Become a Trade Partner” to register.  We do not send release emails.  Each vendor is required to check BWP daily for any releases and/or schedule changes.  Below are some quick training videos to get you up and running on BWP.  They usually answer 95% of questions you’ll have.  They’re very short.  Please let Mike Michalski at Mike.Michalski@pulte.com <mailto:Mike.Michalski@pulte.com>  know if you have any questions after watching them.

We were called out to this dr home for a leaking water meter. This home was not plumbed by us.
The concrete company unhooked the meter for some reason. After they put it back together it was leaking from the nuts that thread onto the meter itself
Mikeal said the nuts were just hand tight. After checking for gaskets and tightening the meter nuts the leak was fixed.
 
350 show up plus 250 for one hour labor.

The vent pipe is recommended to be no taller than 6 inches above the roof. I recommend further evaluation and correct as necessary
*Radon vent on the roof is too short - this can become a potential health issue if ever blocked by snow or other objects
*The water pressure was above the normal operating pressure. Anything above 80 PSI is potentially detrimental to the homes water supply lines and fixtures. It is recommended that the pressure regulator be adjusted, and lower the pressure to approximately 65-80 PSI which is adequate for almost all households. Water pressure was measured using a gauge at an exterior hose bib.
• Adjustment to the pressure reducing valve, located in the garage, is needed to bring the pressure in the home into the 40-80 PSI range as required by code. This is the second request for this repair.
*Some of the supply pipe insulation is incomplete in the crawlspace. Be sure all supply lines in unheated spaces have been adequately insulated to protect from freezing conditions that could damage the pipes and to prevent heat loss.

Good morning, 

 

Here is an invitation to a BWP training. Feel free to forward this to anyone in your office that would benefit from this information.

 

Please remember that we use our own scheduling system called Build with Pulte…or BWP.  The web address is [bwp.pulte.com]bwp.pulte.com. Once there click “Become a Trade Partner” to register.  We do not send release emails.  Each vendor is required to check BWP daily for any releases and/or schedule changes.  Below are some quick training videos to get you up and running on BWP.  They usually answer 95% of questions you’ll have.  They’re very short.  Please let Mike Michalski at Mike.Michalski@pulte.com <mailto:Mike.Michalski@pulte.com>  know if you have any questions after watching them.

Hello everyone! Please see the updated address for this event. We will now be meeting at the Battle Ground Farmers Market space. Thank you Max for helping us out with this!

 

Hello! 

 

We would like to invite you to a kickoff for the 2026 show and get us all on the same page early on for an amazing show! Please be sure someone from your company is in attendance if you are not able to be, so that you are informed. Past builders, even if you aren’t building in the 2026 show, we encourage you to come and learn about changes being made.

Please let me know if you have any questions
